# gish
gish is a simple program i made as a test to learn bash 


to configure gish after installing open the terminal and type chmod +x gish

then type nano .bashrc or vim if you have vim then go to the end of the file and type  
#### ALIASES #####
alias gish='./gish'

then save and exit and you should be good just type gish to start 

oh and this is my first time doing any of this so i might have messed up things.
