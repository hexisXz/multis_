# gish
gish is a simple program i made as a test to learn bash

to install go to the terminal and type git clone https://github.com/xxhexisxx/gish.git and rename the folder to gish_ or anything you want next you need
to configure gish after installing  so open up the terminal and type chmod +x gish

then type nano .bashrc or vim if you have vim then go to the end of the file and type  
#### ALIASES #####
alias gish='./gish'

then save and exit then move gish to home or ~ and you should be good just type gish to start. 

oh and this is my first time doing any of this so i might have messed up things.
and if you look in the code ate the end it says  check for invalid argument thats nothing i just forgot to romove that
